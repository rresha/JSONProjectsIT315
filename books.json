Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.",

There is a strong, fierce heroine and her swoon-worthy personal guard, which leads to some pretty smouldering romance. but love isnt the only emotion - this story is overflowing with bravery, suspense, loyalty, curiosity, vengeance, and friendship. - BretmanRock",

			"TopReview": "Most zombie books/movies are the same, and this is no different. The apocalypse starts and the challenge is to figh against zombies while maintaining your humanity. While this had the potential to delve into the very essence of humanity and pander whether the human race is truly awful, but the book glosses over the darker stuff. It has that happy, mushy ending that we all know would never happen. Yet you can't help but love it. After all, who doesn't love a happy ending? -- Andrea Jackson",
